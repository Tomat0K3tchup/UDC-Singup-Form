    "knowledgeRisk": "I, <strong class='liabilityName'></strong>, hereby affirm that I am a certified scuba diver trained in safe dive practices, or a student diver under the control and supervision of a certified scuba instructor. I know that skin diving, freediving and scuba diving have inherent risks including those risks associated with boat travel to and from the dive site (hereinafter “Excursion”), which may result in serious injury or death.",
    "dcsRisk": "I understand that scuba diving with compressed air involves certain inherent risks; including but not limited to decompression sickness, embolism or other hyperbaric/air expansion injury that require treatment in a recompression chamber. If I am scuba diving with oxygen enriched air (“Enriched Air”) or other gas blends including oxygen, I also understand that it involves inherent risks of oxygen toxicity and/or improper mixtures of breathing gas.",
    "boatRisk": "I acknowledge this Excursion includes risks of slipping or falling while on board the boat, being cut or struck by a boat while in the water, injuries occurring while getting on or off a boat, and other perils of the sea. I further understand that the Excursion will be conducted at a site that is remote, either by time or distance or both, from a recompression chamber. I still choose to proceed with the Excursion in spite of the absence of a recompression chamber in proximity to the dive site(s).",
    "udcLiability": "I understand and agree that neither <strong>Utila Dive Center</strong>; nor the dive professional(s) who may be present at the dive site, nor PADI Americas, Inc., nor any of their affiliate and subsidiary corporations, nor any of their respective employees, officers, agents, contractors and assigns (hereinafter “Released Parties”) may be held liable or responsible in any way for any injury, death or other damages to me, my family, estate, heirs or assigns that may occur during the Excursion as a result of my participation in the Excursion or as a result of the negligence of any party, including the Released Parties, whether passive or active.",
    "goodHealth": "I affirm I am in good mental and physical fitness for the Excursion. I further state that I will not participate in the Excursion if I am under the influence of alcohol or any drugs that are contraindicated to diving. If I am taking medication, I affirm that I have seen a physician and have approval to dive while under the influence of the medication/drugs. I understand that diving is a physically strenuous activity and that I will be exerting myself during the Excursion and that if I am injured as a result of heart attack, panic, hyperventilation, drowning or any other cause, that I expressly assume the risk of said injuries and that I will not hold the Released Parties responsible for the same.",
    "divePractices": "I am aware that safe dive practices suggest diving with a buddy unless trained as a self-reliant diver. I am aware it is my responsibility to plan my dive allowing for my diving experience and limitations, and the prevailing water conditions and environment. I will not hold the Released Parties responsible for my failure to safely plan my dive, dive my plan, and follow the instructions and dive briefing of the dive professional(s).",
    "boatDiving": "If diving from a boat, I will be present at and attentive to the briefing given by the boat crew. If there is anything I do not understand I will notify the boat crew or captain immediately. I acknowledge it is my responsibility to plan my dives as no-decompression dives, and within parameters that allow me to make a safety stop before ascending to the surface, arriving on board the vessel with gas remaining in my cylinder as a measure of safety. If I become distressed on the surface I will immediately drop my weights and inflate my BCD (orally or with low pressure inflator) to establish buoyancy on the surface.",
    "refresher": "I am aware safe dive practices recommend a refresher or guided orientation dive following a period of diving inactivity. I understand such refresher/guided dive is available for an additional fee. If I choose not to follow this recommendation I will not hold the Released Parties responsible for my decision.",
    "staffLiability": "I acknowledge Released Parties may provide an in-water guide (hereinafter “Guide”) during the Excursion. The Guide is present to assist in navigation during the dive and identifying local flora and fauna. If I choose to dive with the Guide I acknowledge it is my responsibility to stay in proximity to the Guide during the dive. I assume all risks associated with my choice whether to dive in proximity to the Guide or to dive independent of the Guide. I acknowledge my participation in diving is at my own risk and peril.",
    "gearLiability": "I affirm it is my responsibility to inspect all of the equipment I will be using prior to the leaving the dock for the Excursion and that I should not dive if the equipment is not functioning properly. I will not hold the Released Parties responsible for my failure to inspect the equipment prior to diving or if I choose to dive with equipment that may not be functioning properly.",
    "rescue": "I acknowledge Released Parties have made no representation to me, implied or otherwise, that they or their crew can or will perform affective rescues or render first aid. In the event I show signs of distress or call for aid I would like assistance and will not hold the Released Parties, their crew, dive boats or passengers responsible for their actions in attempting the performance of rescue or first aid.",
