<h2>Release of Liability/Assumption of Risk/Non-agency Acknowledgment Form - DIVER ACTIVITIES</h2>

<p>Please read carefully before signing.</p>

<h3>NON-AGENCY DISCLOSURE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT AGREEMENT</h3>
<p>
  I understand and agree that PADI Members (“Members”), including
  <strong>Utila Dive Center</strong>, and/or any individual PADI Instructors and Divemasters
  associated with the program in which I am participating, are licensed to use various PADI
  Trademarks and to conduct PADI training, but are not agents, employees or franchisees of PADI
  Americas, Inc., or its parent, subsidiary and affiliated corporations (“PADI”).
</p>

<p>
  I further understand that Member business activities are independent, and are neither owned nor
  operated by PADI, and that while PADI establishes the standards for PADI diver training programs,
  it is not responsible for, nor does it have the right to control, the operation of the Members’
  business activities and the day-to-day conduct of PADI programs and supervision of divers by the
  Members or their associated staff.
</p>
<p>
  I further understand and agree on behalf of myself, my heirs and my estate that in the event of an
  injury or death during this activity, neither I nor my estate shall seek to hold PADI liable for
  the actions, inactions or negligence of the entities listed above and/or the instructors and
  divemasters associated with the activity.
</p>

<h3>LIABILITY RELEASE AND ASSUMPTION OF RISK AGREEMENT</h3>

<p>
  I, <strong class="liability_name"></strong>, hereby affirm that I am a certified scuba diver
  trained in safe dive practices, or a student diver under the control and supervision of a
  certified scuba instructor. I know that skin diving, freediving and scuba diving have inherent
  risks including those risks associated with boat travel to and from the dive site (hereinafter
  “Excursion”), which may result in serious injury or death.
</p>
<p>
  I understand that scuba diving with compressed air involves certain inherent risks; including but
  not limited to decompression sickness, embolism or other hyperbaric/air expansion injury that
  require treatment in a recompression chamber. If I am scuba diving with oxygen enriched air
  (“Enriched Air”) or other gas blends including oxygen, I also understand that it involves inherent
  risks of oxygen toxicity and/or improper mixtures of breathing gas.
</p>
<p>
  I acknowledge this Excursion includes risks of slipping or falling while on board the boat, being
  cut or struck by a boat while in the water, injuries occurring while getting on or off a boat, and
  other perils of the sea. I further understand that the Excursion will be conducted at a site that
  is remote, either by time or distance or both, from a recompression chamber. I still choose to
  proceed with the Excursion in spite of the absence of a recompression chamber in proximity to the
  dive site(s).
</p>
<p>
  I understand and agree that neither <strong>Utila Dive Center</strong> nor the dive
  professional(s) who may be present at the dive site, nor PADI Americas, Inc., nor any of their
  affiliate and subsidiary corporations, nor any of their respective employees, officers, agents,
  contractors and assigns (hereinafter “Released Parties”) may be held liable or responsible in any
  way for any injury, death or other damages to me, my family, estate, heirs or assigns that may
  occur during the Excursion as a result of my participation in the Excursion or as a result of the
  negligence of any party, including the Released Parties, whether passive or active.
</p>

<p>
  I affirm I am in good mental and physical fitness for the Excursion. I further state that I will
  not participate in the Excursion if I am under the influence of alcohol or any drugs that are
  contraindicated to diving. If I am taking medication, I affirm that I have seen a physician and
  have approval to dive while under the influence of the medication/drugs. I understand that diving
  is a physically strenuous activity and that I will be exerting myself during the Excursion and
  that if I am injured as a result of heart attack, panic, hyperventilation, drowning or any other
  cause, that I expressly assume the risk of said injuries and that I will not hold the Released
  Parties responsible for the same.
</p>
<p>
  I am aware that safe dive practices suggest diving with a buddy unless trained as a self-reliant
  diver. I am aware it is my responsibility to plan my dive allowing for my diving experience and
  limitations, and the prevailing water conditions and environment. I will not hold the Released
  Parties responsible for my failure to safely plan my dive, dive my plan, and follow the
  instructions and dive briefing of the dive professional(s).
</p>
<p>
  If diving from a boat, I will be present at and attentive to the briefing given by the boat crew.
  If there is anything I do not understand I will notify the boat crew or captain immediately. I
  acknowledge it is my responsibility to plan my dives as no- decompression dives, and within
  parameters that allow me to make a safety stop before ascending to the surface, arriving on board
  the vessel with gas remaining in my cylinder as a measure of safety. If I become distressed on the
  surface I will immediately drop my weights and inflate my BCD (orally or with low pressure
  inflator) to establish buoyancy on the surface.
</p>
<p>
  I am aware safe dive practices recommend a refresher or guided orientation dive following a period
  of diving inactivity. I understand such refresher/guided dive is available for an additional fee.
  If I choose not to follow this recommendation I will not hold the Released Parties responsible for
  my decision.
</p>
<p>
  I acknowledge Released Parties may provide an in-water guide (hereinafter “Guide”) during the
  Excursion. The Guide is present to assist in navigation during the dive and identifying local
  flora and fauna. If I choose to dive with the Guide I acknowledge it is my responsibility to stay
  in proximity to the Guide during the dive. I assume all risks associated with my choice whether to
  dive in proximity to the Guide or to dive independent of the Guide. I acknowledge my participation
  in diving is at my own risk and peril.
</p>
<p>
  I affirm it is my responsibility to inspect all of the equipment I will be using prior to the
  leaving the dock for the Excursion and that I should not dive if the equipment is not functioning
  properly. I will not hold the Released Parties responsible for my failure to inspect the equipment
  prior to diving or if I choose to dive with equipment that may not be functioning properly.
</p>
<p>
  I acknowledge Released Parties have made no representation to me, implied or otherwise, that they
  or their crew can or will perform affective rescues or render first aid. In the event I show signs
  of distress or call for aid I would like assistance and will not hold the Released Parties, their
  crew, dive boats or passengers responsible for their actions in attempting the performance of
  rescue or first aid. I hereby state and agree that this Agreement will be effective for all
  Excursions in which I participate for one (1) year from the date on which I sign this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
  I further state that I am of lawful age and legally competent to sign this liability release, or
  that I have acquired the written consent of my parent or guardian. I understand the terms herein
  are contractual and not a mere recital, and that I have signed this Agreement of my own free act
  and with the knowledge that I hereby agree to waive my legal rights. I further agree that if any
  provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be
  severed from this Agreement. The remainder of this Agreement will then be construed as though the
  unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. I understand and agree that I am not only
  giving up my right to sue the Released Parties but also any rights my heirs, assigns, or
  beneficiaries may have to sue the Released Parties resulting from my death. I further represent
  that I have the authority to do so and that my heirs, assigns, and beneficiaries will be estopped
  from claiming otherwise because of my representations to the Released Parties.
</p>
<p>
  I, <strong class="liability_name"></strong>, BY THIS INSTRUMENT, AGREE TO EXEMPT AND RELEASE THE
  RELEASED PARTIES DEFINED ABOVE FROM ALL LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER FOR PERSONAL
  INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE OR WRONGFUL DEATH HOWEVER CAUSED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE
  NEGLIGENCE OF THE RELEASED PARTIES, WHETHER PASSIVE OR ACTIVE. I HAVE FULLY INFORMED MYSELF AND MY
  HEIRS OF THE CONTENTS OF THIS NON-AGENCY DISCLOSURE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT AGREEMENT, AND LIABILITY
  RELEASE AND ASSUMPTION OF RISK AGREEMENT BY READING BOTH BEFORE SIGNING BELOW ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
  AND MY HEIRS.
